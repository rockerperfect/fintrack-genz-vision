# Fintrack GenZ Vision - Project Context

## Overview
A modern, professional, mobile-first fintech dashboard designed specifically for Gen Z users. The application focuses on financial literacy, goal tracking, and smart money management with a clean, polished interface suitable for a professional fintech environment.

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design system
- **Shadcn/ui** components for consistent, accessible UI primitives

### Design System & Styling
- **Professional Fintech Palette**: Deep navy primary (#1e3a8a), clean grays, and strategic accent colors
- **Mobile-First Approach**: All components designed for touch interactions and small screens
- **Consistent Spacing**: 44px minimum touch targets, proper padding/margins for mobile
- **Soft Shadows**: Subtle depth instead of harsh glows for professional appearance
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy and line spacing

### State Management & Data
- **Local Storage**: All data persistence using browser localStorage for offline capability
- **React State**: Component-level state management with hooks
